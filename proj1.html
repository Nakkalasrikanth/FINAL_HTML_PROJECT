      Salaar: Part 1 – Ceasefire is a high-intensity action drama directed by
      Prashanth Neel that introduces a dark, violent world ruled by power and
      loyalty. The film follows Deva, a mysterious and formidable man with a
      buried past, who is pulled back into conflict to protect his childhood
      friend Varadha, a royal heir in the brutal kingdom of Khansaar. As
      political conspiracies, betrayals, and rival clans collide, the story
      focuses on world-building and character dynamics rather than resolving the
      central conflict, making the film a large-scale setup for the coming war.
      With heavy action, striking visuals, and a powerful background score,
      Ceasefire lays the foundation for the explosive events promised in Part 2.
